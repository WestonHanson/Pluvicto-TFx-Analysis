# Genomic Instibility vs Tumor Fraction or Central Depth Over Time Pipeline for cfDNA ULP-WGS Data 

A script developed to process and give insight into genomic instibilty (fraction genome altered : FGA) vs tumor fraction (TFx) or central depth data over time points for cell-free DNA (cfDNA) ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing (ULP-WGS) data.
<br/><br/>

## Desprition
This script integrates features from *[ichorCNA](https://github.com/GavinHaLab/ichorCNA)*, *[Triton](https://github.com/GavinHaLab/TritonNP)*, and clinical progression data to derive logitudinal changes in genomic instabily over time, specifically understanding its relationship to tumor fraction and transciption factor binding site expression. 

## Inputs
*Inputs can be specified in the input file*
| Input | Definition |
| ----- | ---------- |
| genomic instability file paths: | Paths to ichorCNA batch run *directories* |
| tumor fraction file paths: | Path to tumor fraction meta data |
| patient treatment progression: | Path to progression cycle meta data |
| central depth file path: | Path to Triton central depth file |
| time point: | Sets what time points will be used in FGA vs TFX scatter plots (seperate by commas) |
| genomic instability and tumor fraction data processing: | Calculates genomic instability and tumor fraction of each sample
| central depth data processing: | Grabs central depth value for each sample's TFBS site
| combine data tables: | Combines FGA/TFx and central depth data tables *(necessary for downstream analysis)*
| genomic instability and tumor fraction scatter plots: | Creates a scatter plot of FGA vs TFx for all patients at C1 (above 3% TFX)
| genomic instability and tumor fraction line plots: | Creates line plots for FGA and/or TFx split into 2 plots (no samples below 3% TFx and if any sample is below 3% TFx) - grouped by patients last time point
| central depth pca plot: | Creates two PCA plots for central depth values - one for sample and feature normalizations, respectively. 
| central depth heatmap: | Creates a heatmap of central depth values from parameters selected in main.py. Dendrogram shows clustering and colored bars on top show TFx grouping and responder vs non-responder groups.
| save heatmap data frames: | Saves the heatmap dataframe into a TSV in ```/data-tables```
| central depth differential activity: | Creates a heatmap similar to *central depth heatmap* above, but only shows significantly differencially expressed TFBS's.
| central depth and tumor fraction density plot: | Density plot of TFx vs central depth values across C1 patients.
| central depth and tumor fraction regression: | Creates 3 plots: 1) a heatmap of signficicantly differentially expressed TFBS's with TFx regressed out. 2) A scatter plot of the residuals vs TFx. And 3) Central depth vs TFx for a specific gene that you can select in main.py.
| central depth and tumor fraction spearman rho plot: | Creates two directories: low and high spearman rho statistics. It calculates spearman rho on each TFBS vs TFx and puts it in its respective directory. Then it creates a distribution plot of spearman rho values.
| cox forest plots of sig tfbs against clinical data: | In progress...


## Outputs 
(Does not include all veriations of outputs) <p>
*Output can be specifed in the input file and processes can be found and edited in main.py*
| Process    | Output File Name                        | Output Description |
|----------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Process 1 | `outputs/data-tables/FGA_data_table.tsv` | Data table showing TFx and FGA for each patient at each time point (as well as the patients progression cycle group) |
| Process 2 | `outputs/data-tables/central_depth_data_table.tsv` | Per-sample central depth table created from the raw "central-depth" feature. Columns include patient_id, time_point, site, and central_depth (also saved as mean_depth for compatibility).
| Process 3 | `outputs/data-tables/combined_data_table.tsv` | Combined data table which merges FGA and central depth on patient_id and time_point. Includes metadata such as progression_cycle, tumor_fraction, and genomic_instability.
| Process 4 | `outputs/tumor%_vs_FGA_grt_0.03tfx.png` | A scatter plot of TFx by FGA across all patients only above 3% TFx.
| Process 5 | `outputs/mean_<FGA/tfx>_over_time_by_progression_cycle_SEM_filtered.png` | A line plot of the mean of patients at each cycle for FGA or TFx.
|&#x21B3;|`outputs/treatment_cycle_<cycle>_split_by_<fga/tfx>_over_time.png` | A line plot of TFx or FGA for each cycle split by if any samples went below 3% TFx.
| Process 6 | `outputs/central_depth_PCA_normalized_by_<normalization>.png` | PCA scatter plot - Plot shows PC1 vs PC2 for C1 samples and is color-coded by TFx group (low/medium/high). 
| Process 7 | `outputs/normalized_<normalization>_<number/all>_tfbs_by_variance_heatmap.png` | Clustered central depth heatmap image produced. Heatmap includes top TFBS by variance and annotation bars for progression group and tumor group. 
|&#x21B3;| `outputs/data-tables/heatmap_data_table.tsv` | Heatmap-ready table saved; contains normalized central depth values (per chosen normalization level), patient metadata, and progression/tumor group annotations. 
| Process 8 | `outputs/sig_diff_exp_sites_normalized_<normalization>_from_<number/all>_by_variance_heatmap.png` | Clustered central depth heatmap image produced. Heatmap includes only significantly differentially expressed TFBS's. Has annotation bars for progression group and tumor group. 
| Process 9 | `outputs/tfx_vs_CD_scatter_plot.png` | A density plot of TFx vs CD to see how correlated TFx is with central depth.
| Process 10 | `outputs/diff_sig_exp_residuals_normalized_<normalization>_<number/all>_tfbs_CI_<pvalue_cutoff>_heatmap.png` | Clustered central depth heatmap image produced. Heatmap includes only significantly differentially expressed TFBS residuals - meaning TFx has been regressed out of central depth. Has annotation bars for progression group and tumor group.
|&#x21B3;| `outputs/tfx_central_depth_residual_plot.png` | A scatter plot of TFx vs central depth with a pearson coefficient value to interpret if TFx is correlated with central depth.
|&#x21B3;|  `outputs/tfx_vs_CD_scatter_plot_specific_genes.png` | A scatter plot for a specific gene of TFx vs central depth with a pearson coefficient value to interpret if TFx is correlated with central depth.
| Process 11 | `outputs/rho-stat-high` | A scatter plot for every TFBS that had a rho stat greater than or equal to 0.5 - TFx vs central depth - only significant values.
|&#x21B3;| `outputs/rho-stat-low` | A scatter plot for every TFBS that had a rho stat less than 0.5 - TFx vs central depth - only significant values.
|&#x21B3;| `outputs/temp_histogram.png` | A histogram of the distribution of spearman rho values acorss significant values. 
| Process 12 | *In process...* |

!! Most scatter plots or heatmaps are "responder" vs "non-responder" and that is a user defined variable based on cycles to progression that you can change in each process in main.py !!
